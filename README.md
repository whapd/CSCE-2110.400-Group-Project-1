Project 1: Campus Resource Reservation System
Project Overview
Universities manage a variety of resources every day, including study rooms, tutoring appointments, laptops, calculators, and laboratory equipment. Students frequently request access to these resources, and administrators must efficiently manage reservations, waiting lists, cancellations, and usage reports.

In this project, your team will develop a Campus Resource Reservation System that allows users to reserve campus resources, manage waiting lists, track reservation history, and generate reports.

The goal of this project is to apply object-oriented programming and fundamental data structures to solve a realistic problem.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, students will be able to:

Design and implement a moderately sized C++ software system.
Apply object-oriented programming principles.
Read and write structured data files.
Implement and use linked lists.
Implement and use stacks.
Implement and use queues.
Analyze algorithm efficiency.
Implement searching algorithms.
Implement sorting algorithms.
Collaborate using GitHub.
Develop modular and maintainable code.
Functional Requirements
Resource Management
The system shall:

Load resource data from input files.
Store information about available resources.
Display all resources.
Search for resources.
Sort resources according to user-selected criteria.
Resources may include:

Study Rooms
Laptops
Calculators
Lab Equipment
Tutoring appointments
Each resource must contain:

Resource ID
Resource Name
Resource Type
Availability Status
Reservation Management
Users shall be able to:

Create a reservation.
Cancel a reservation.
View current reservations.
Search for reservations.
Each reservation must contain:

Reservation ID
Student ID
Student Name
Resource ID
Reservation Date
Waiting List Management
When a resource is unavailable:

Student requests must be placed in a waiting queue.
Requests must be processed in FIFO order.
Available resources must automatically be assigned to the next waiting user.
Reservation History
The system shall maintain a cancellation history.

When a reservation is cancelled:

It is stored on a stack.
Users may undo the most recent cancellation.
Only the most recently cancelled reservation may be restored.

Reporting
The system shall generate reports including:

Most frequently reserved resources
Current availability
Number of active reservations
Waiting list reports
Non-Functional Requirements
Code Organization
Separate implementation and header files.
Main function must be in its own source file.
Use meaningful file and class names.
Documentation
Source code must contain comments.
README file required.
Function-level documentation encouraged.
User Interface
Menu-driven command-line interface.

Error Handling
The system must:

Validate all menu selections.
Validate file opening.
Prevent duplicate reservation IDs.
Prevent invalid resource IDs.
Handle empty stacks.
Handle empty waiting queues.
Sample Execution
Create Reservation
Student ID: 1001

Student Name: Alice Smith

Resource ID: R205

Reservation Created Successfully.


Cancel Reservation
Reservation ID: 301

Reservation Cancelled.

Added to cancellation history.


Undo Cancellation
Reservation Restored Successfully.


GitHub Requirements
All teams must:

Create a GitHub repository.
Have all members contribute commits.
Use meaningful commit messages.
Create at least one feature branch.
Merge at least one branch into main.

Examples of acceptable commit messages:
Implemented reservation linked list

Added waiting queue functionality

Fixed resource search bug

Milestone 1 – Core System Development (Due on 9/20)
Objectives
Develop the core functionality of the Campus Resource Reservation System and establish the team's collaboration workflow.

By the end of this milestone, the system should support resource management, reservations, waiting lists, cancellation tracking, and team collaboration through GitHub.


Required Features
Resource Management
The system shall:

Load resource information from a file.
Store resource information.
Display all resources.
Display resource availability.

Reservation Management
The system shall:

Create reservations.
Cancel reservations.
Display active reservations.
Validate reservation requests.

Linked List Implementation
A linked list must be used to store active reservations.

The implementation must support:

Insert reservation
Remove reservation
Traverse reservation records
Display reservation information

Waiting List Management
A queue must be used for waiting lists.

The implementation must support:

Add student to waiting list
Remove student from waiting list
Display waiting list

Cancellation History
A stack must be used for cancellation tracking.

The implementation must support:

Store cancelled reservations
Restore the most recently cancelled reservation
Display cancellation history

 Complexity Analysis
Provide a short report discussing:

Reservation insertion complexity
Reservation removal complexity
Waiting-list processing complexity
Undo cancellation complexity
Include Big-O notation and brief explanations.


GitHub Collaboration
After the Project Management module, teams must:

Reservations can be cancelled
Waiting lists function correctly
Undo functionality works correctly
Invalid input is handled properly

Final Project Submission (Due on 10/11)
Objectives
Complete and refine the system by implementing searching, sorting, reporting, testing, and full integration.

Resources sorted by name
Resources sorted by popularity
Reservations sorted by date

Reporting
Generate system reports including:

Active reservations

Most requested resources
Waiting-list statistics

System Integration
All project components must function together within a unified system.

The program should provide a consistent user interface and robust error handling.


Testing
Teams should conduct comprehensive testing and document the results.

Submit a zip file containing following files:

Complete source code
Header files
README
User documentation
GitHub repository URL
The README, source code, and header files should match those that we find in your GitHub code repository. 


Academic Integrity
All submitted work must be created entirely by your group.

You may NOT:

• Copy code from other students or groups
• Download project solutions
• Use AI-generated code (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, etc.)
• Use code obtained from online sources without instructor permission

Discussion of concepts and algorithms is permitted.

Sharing source code, project files, or AI-generated implementations is prohibited and will be treated as academic dishonesty.

Failure to compile, inability to explain submitted code, or violations of the Academic Integrity policy may result in significant grade deductions and may be referred for further academic review.

All group members must be able to explain the code they submit.


Final Advice
Start early.

Most project failures occur because groups:

delay integration
fail to test incrementally
wait until the last week to combine code
Build and test your system gradually throughout the project timeline.
